Camera: A view of tornado shown in the distance as a car drives through heavy rain. Lightning
occasionally illuminates the scene, and the car's wipers are on.
Aaron: Go. Go go go go go go go go go. Is the camera on?
Micah: Yeah.
Aaron: OK I'm here with Micah and Danny.
Micah: Yo!
Danny: What uuuuuup!
Aaron: Micah's got the wheel and Danny's gonna come to you with the play-by-play. Uh Danny,
what do you uh,
Danny: So we're live in the middle of Game 3887. Field of play Nebraska, end zones Wyoming
and Iowa, next score wins.
Camera: A map of the US states of Wyoming, Nebraska and Iowa, set against a black
background. Wyoming is depicted as a bright yellow rectangle in the upper left corner of the
image, with the word "WYOMING" written in a black, blocky font vertically inside the rectangle.
Nebraska is depicted as a dark gray shape to the right of Wyoming, with the state’s name not
included on the map. Iowa is depicted as a bright red rectangle in the upper right corner of the
image, with the word "IOWA" written in a white, serif font vertically inside the rectangle. The
white outlines of the state borders are clearly visible.
Aaron: Next score wins, yeah, and it's tied 24-24. A lot of guys are trying to chase this game, but
we're the only ones who have been on top of it the whole time. We've been chasing it eight
years now.
Micah: Eight and a half years now.
Aaron: Yeah, eight and a half years now. Micah, speed up.
Micah: Dude I can't. ****in, the cop won't let me pass.
Aaron: Oh. Uhh, hold on, get up next to him. Roll down the window.
Aaron: Sir! Hello, officer?
Cop: You boys need to keep your distance.
Aaron: Sir, we're just trying to shoot Game 3887.
Cop: You can do that from out here. You don't need to get close to the twister.
Micah: This is stupid dude, I've been in like 20 twisters.
Aaron: Officer, we've been in a lot of tornadoes. We know how to handle ourselves. This game
here is headed straight toward the tornado. It might go up in the twister.
Cop: You're plenty close for that.
Aaron: Sir, if we could just
Cop: This is not a debate! I am not going to debate with you! I am, what I'm gonna do is I will
pull you over and bring all three of you before the county magistrate. Do you want that?
Aaron: No, officer!
Micah: Sorry officer!
Aaron: This is bull****.
Danny: Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hey no, it's cool! Look!
Micah: Is that Nancy?
Aaron: That's Nancy! This is…gimme the camera. Everybody, you're looking at Nancy
McGunnell, about uh, 500 feet outside our driver's side door. She's running eastbound, just
north of
Danny: You want me to do a game reset real quick? We got some more followers, looks like we
got like 400 viewers right now.
Aaron: Oh damn! OK yeah.
Danny: OK so it's July 2nd, 17776. We are in…we are just about a mile east of Seward,
Nebraska, driving eastbound on McKelvie Road. We're following Wyoming running back Nancy
McGunnell, who is now about 82, 83 percent of the way across the state.
Camera: The map focuses on southeast Nebraska, specifically around the town of Seward. A
football's path, highlighted as a line, stretches eastward across the map. A tornado graphic,
moving southeast from the northwest, appears on a collision course with the football.
Danny: This game's been tied at 24-24 for about a year. Right now, McGunnell and Wyoming
have the best chance they've had in a while to put this one away. As the crow flies, she's only
about 117,000 yards from the goal line.
Camera: The zoomed-out view reveals the football's journey, now a long line stretching across
the map. It's a considerable distance from Iowa, which remains highlighted in red.
Aaron: Where do you think she's headed? Straight across?
Danny: Well if I were her, I might actually cut northeast just a little bit to try and cross in Omaha.
Lots of buildings, lots of suburb, plenty of places to hide.
Camera: The map now focuses on Omaha, Nebraska, a city nestled right along the border of
Iowa. Buildings and streets are visible in detail.
Danny: And you know, if you're in an urban center, it's damn near impossible to chase down a
lone ball carrier, no matter how many defenders you have. A long time ago I was calling a game
that went through Knoxville. Guy caught a pass and disappeared into the city one night. There
were no fewer than five thousand defenders looking for him. Took 'em months.
Aaron: Five thousand!
Danny: Yeah, it was one of those mob games. They finally found him in a broom closet in one of
those big buildings downtown, he was
Micah: **** dude, she is running right toward the tornado.
Aaron: Dude she is.
Micah: She's ****in' crazy. Nancy is ****in' crazy.
Camera: An image of a yellow football card for player number 3500, Nancy McGunnell. In the
top left and right corners are footballs labeled “3500” and “17776 Elite”. The top center shows
her name, height of 5'7", weight of 185 pounds, and birth of May 2, 1953 in Jonesboro,
Arkansas. Below are her stats from her time playing for Milwaukee's Third Ward from 16003 to
16016, followed by a period where she helped look after her daughter’s general store from
16017 to 17759, then returning to play for Wyoming from 17760 to 17775. Below the statistics is
a black football helmet titled “Off the Gridiron” with the following fact: Before recently un-retiring,
Nancy helped her daughter run a general store. The card is copyrighted 17776 Elite Collectibles
in the bottom right corner.
Danny: No, I like this, I like this. I've seen this done.
Aaron: You've seen what, a player run up into a twister?
Danny: Yep. She planned this. I guarantee that Wyoming planned for this. Here, I can draw this
up for everybody.
Camera: The scene shifts to Gresham, Nebraska, where two football teams, marked by X's and
O's, are lined up on either side of a road. A green line appears behind the O's, and as the map
zooms out, a path connecting them to the football graphic in Seward becomes visible. The
sequence ends with the football located south of the team in Gresham.
Danny: This morning, the line of scrimmage started in Gresham. Nancy caught a screen pass,
actually ran backwards a couple blocks, then just bolted down Road V until she hit Lincoln
Creek. She followed the creek for 20 miles, and
Aaron: For the cover.
Danny: Yeah, for the cover. By running on the far side of the creek, the creek kind of, it becomes
like a blocker. All of a sudden, Nancy's got nothing but daylight until the next bridge. They finally
get to the bridge by Seward, which, Seward's got something like 12 streets running vertical and
horizontal. That's real good news for a runner with Nancy's speed.
Micah: Y'all she's…see her? Twister's moving south, southeast. Nancy's gonna be
Aaron: Oh ****.
Micah: right up on the tornado.
Danny: Which is, that's obviously what she's trying to do. Look at the third and fourth lines of
defenders. They're closing in…with all these plains, she's not gonna have any cover, they'll see
her from a mile off. Only way she can shake them now is if that twister picks her up and throws
her downfield.
Camera: The view zooms out to encompass a larger area of Nebraska, revealing two lines of Xs
representing another team in Lincoln, Nebraska. They are heading eastbound towards the
football graphic in Seward, Nebraska.
Micah: It's an EF5.
Danny: That's an EF5?
Micah: Oh, it's absolutely an EF5. Look at that. See that flying around?
Danny: Yeah.
Micah: House.
Danny: ****.
Aaron: Oh ****.
Danny: How far do you think it might throw her?
Micah: Pffff…I don't know, I mean just by looking at it, it's one of the strongest-looking tornadoes
I've ever seen. A human being could go five miles, ten miles. Only thing is, there's no telling
which direction.
Micah: So I mean we're coming right up on this thing. Any closer and we're gonna get crushed
by a flying train car or some **** like that. And I just bought this damn truck.
Aaron: bull**** you just bought it! You bought it like 40 years ago.
Micah: Nah, man!
Aaron: No bull**** man, you did! Remember, I was there with you. Remember when we went to
uh, Davenport and we bought it off that dude?
Micah: Man I don't know, maybe. Who gives a ****, this is one of the best trucks I've ever had.
Aaron: Why? What about this ****in' 11083 Silverado is
Micah: It's a 12083 Silverado.
Aaron: different from-- okay yeah, exactly. 11083, 12083, what is the difference?
Aaron: Name one thing that's different. A thousand years, name me one thing that's different.
Micah: You can fit a big pop into the cup holder.
Aaron: Pop holder.
Micah: Cup holder. Obviously you can hold pop in it but you don't have to restrict it to
Aaron: You like this truck because you can roll around sippin' a goddamn 800-ounce chug-a-lug
or whatever.
Micah: [laughing]
Aaron: [laughing] You're such a dumb*** dude. You're a dumb***.
Danny: Look look look look. She's like almost there. She's like right there.
Aaron: Whoa we got like lots of people watching.
Aaron: We've got like…6,000 people watching.
Micah: Is that a record?
Aaron: For us I think so, yeah.
Danny: OK so for everybody who's just tuning in, Nancy McGunnell is about 25 miles into a
run—dude, don't point it at me! The twister, look at the twister!
Aaron: Sorry.
Danny: She's trying to, or at least we think she's trying to get herself caught in the tornado and
get flung somewhere downfield. You are watching football history right now as
Micah: Earlier I was keeping pace with her, she was probably running 20 miles an hour. Easy.
Danny: Which, and that's what makes her one of the best running backs playing in the Midwest
right now. If she can create a little bit of space and go on a distance run, she might turn the jets
on you at any
Aaron: She's going up!
Danny: SHE IS…
Danny: NANCY'S UP IN THE TWISTER! SHE HAS LEFT THE
Micah: HOLY ****
Danny: GROUND AND SHE IS AIRBORNE. SHE IS AIRBORNE.
Aaron: Dad, look at my channel. Tell Mom to put on my channel right now. Right now.
Micah: She's like 40 feet in the
Danny: SHE JUST WENT, SHE JUST WHOOSHED UP, SHE'S NOW 100 FEET IN THE AIR,
200
Aaron: I don't know, I just posted it. Just seriously,
Micah: OH MY GOD
Danny: 400 FEET IN THE AIR, HAS TO BE
Aaron: just look it up. I gotta go.
Danny: SHE IS NOT COMING DOWN, SHE IS IN THE FUNNEL, MOVING UH,
SOUTH-SOUTHEAST AT
Nine interrupting: wait
Nine: Wait wait wait wait wait. Stop.
Juice: cmon man what this is gettin good
Nine: This? What is this?
